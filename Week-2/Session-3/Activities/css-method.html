<h2>Shopping History</h2>
<p style="color:red"><strong>I went shopping twice this week (Yesterday and Sunday). I got a bunch of new outfits! One of which I'm currently wearing from Aeropostale.
Sometimes I like to go on my own and listen to music while I shop, butI also enjoy going with my friends. We always end the day with some food (most likely Chipotle) </strong></p>
